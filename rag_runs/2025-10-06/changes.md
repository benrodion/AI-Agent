# Changes as of 2025-10-06, 18:00:

- src/agent/helpers.py: when `execute_agentic_rag`calls `expanded_with_precomputed_neighbours`, the setting `same_parent_only = False` --> Agent can decide if it wants to stay within parent document or search outside to get neighbours


# RAG-Run: 
- ran RAG with `problem_questions_retrieval_precision.json`
